## About me 
Hello, GitHub community! I am a software developer with a unique professional trajectory that combines 16 years of experience as a circus clown with my burgeoning career in technology. This blend has taught me the immense value of creativity, resilience, and the ability to quickly adapt to new challenges, skills that I apply daily in software development.

Following the pandemic, I decided to reinvent myself professionally, diving into the world of programming. Although I did not complete my degree in Computer Engineering due to financial reasons, I have compensated for this with intensive fullstack bootcamps in JavaScript and Ruby on Rails, and recently I have been expanding my knowledge in TypeScript.

As a freelance developer, I have worked on various projects, notably creating an application for circus artists that facilitates their participation in international festivals. This project not only reflects my technical ability but also my capacity to understand and solve specific problems in niche industries.

My professional goals are to continue developing my technical skills, with a particular focus on modern frameworks and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and machine learning. I am looking for opportunities that challenge me and allow me to contribute to innovative projects.

I remain active in the circus world while advancing in my technology career, and I am convinced that the combination of these experiences makes me a unique professional. I encourage other developers to connect with me to explore how we can collaborate and create technological solutions that make a difference!
